          "message": "Publish the throughput numbers CI already measures\n\nBoth throughput runs happen on every CI run, the io_uring path and the\nrecvfrom baseline, three iterations of five seconds each. Neither passed\n--json, which bench/throughput.sh documents as being for\ngithub-action-benchmark, so the numbers were measured and dropped. A\nregression in either would have shown up nowhere.\n\nThey go to dev/throughput now, which is where they went before this project\nmoved accounts and is why that dashboard exists at all. The entry name and\nthe baseline/ prefix match what is already there, so the series continues\nrather than starting beside itself.\n\nMbps, so the tool is customBiggerIsBetter. The two dashboards next to it\nmeasure time and use the opposite, and publishing this one with their\nsetting would have called every improvement a regression.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>",

It has failed on both runs it\nhas ever had, so it has never published a number.\n\nci.yml now measures and stores the same figures, and it takes the\nrecvfrom path as the baseline rather than a second branch, so the\ncomparison comes from one run on one machine. Both files declared the\nsame benchmark name, the same customBiggerIsBetter tool and the same\ndev/throughput directory, so a baseline branch created later would put\ntwo entries per push into one series.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>",
